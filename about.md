## Hi, I’m Anusha Jeyaseelan  

I’m a **Technical Writer and Content Strategist** with over 12 years of experience crafting clear, developer-focused documentation for **cloud computing, security, and machine learning platforms**.  

I specialize in **API documentation, SDKs, developer guides, and content strategy** for large-scale products and developer platforms. My background includes working with **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** and **Cisco Systems**, where I created and standardized API documentation for services like **Elastic Load Balancing, Shield, WAF, Firewall Manager, and Security Lake**, as well as **Cisco Intersight** and **HyperFlex**.

Currently, I’m exploring ways to make technical content more **interactive and educational** — from integrating tutorials with **Amazon SageMaker** to automating documentation workflows using **Python** and **machine learning**.
